Web Performance Observability  

Colleagues Joe Crim (@josephcrim) and Mike McLane (@xyntrix) have helped measure and improve page serve performance at one of the world's largest web hosting providers. They'd like to share experiences with open source and how they went about creating a toolset for consistently quantifying the performance of web hosting. This talk will cover how they got here, why this matters, discoveries made along the way, and include details of their web page performance measurement stack (http://webrockit.io).
